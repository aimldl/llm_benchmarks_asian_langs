# About KLUE RE (Relation Extraction)

## Task Overview

KLUE RE (Relation Extraction) is one of the core tasks in the Korean Language Understanding Evaluation (KLUE) benchmark. This task evaluates a model's ability to identify and classify relationships between entities in Korean text.

## Task Definition

### Input
- **Sentence**: A Korean sentence containing two marked entities
- **Subject Entity**: The first entity with its text and type
- **Object Entity**: The second entity with its text and type

### Output
- **Relation Type**: The relationship between the subject and object entities from a predefined set of relation types

### Example
```
Sentence: "김철수는 삼성전자에서 일한다."
Subject Entity: {"text": "김철수", "type": "PERSON"}
Object Entity: {"text": "삼성전자", "type": "ORGANIZATION"}
Expected Output: "per:employee_of"
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metric
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted relations

### Secondary Metrics
- **Per-relation Accuracy**: Accuracy for each relation type
- **Processing Time**: Time per sample and total time
- **Error Analysis**: Detailed analysis of failed predictions

## Task Challenges

### Linguistic Challenges
1. **Korean Language Complexity**: Korean has complex sentence structures and honorifics
2. **Entity Ambiguity**: Same entity names can refer to different entities
3. **Context Dependency**: Relations often depend on broader context
4. **Implicit Relations**: Some relations are implied rather than explicitly stated

### Technical Challenges
1. **Relation Direction**: Determining the correct direction of relations
2. **Multiple Relations**: Some entity pairs may have multiple relations
3. **No Relation Cases**: Distinguishing between no relation and unclear relations
4. **Entity Boundaries**: Accurate entity identification and boundary detection

## Model Approach

### Prompt Engineering
The benchmark uses a detailed prompt with:
- **Clear Role Definition**: Expert relation extraction AI
- **Comprehensive Guidelines**: Step-by-step analysis instructions
- **Relation Definitions**: Detailed explanations of each relation type
- **Korean Language Optimization**: Specific guidance for Korean text

### Key Features
- **Context Awareness**: Instructions to consider full sentence context
- **Directional Relations**: Clear guidance on relation direction
- **Entity Type Consideration**: Instructions to consider entity types
- **Output Format**: Strict output format requirements

### Response Parsing
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based extraction of relation types
- **Fallback Handling**: Default to "no_relation" for unclear cases
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed responses

## Performance Considerations

### Model Settings
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low for consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: 2048 (increased for detailed responses)
- **Safety Settings**: Minimal blocking for better performance

### Optimization Strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple samples
- **Intermediate Saving**: Regular progress saving for long runs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Appropriate delays between API calls

## Use Cases

### Research Applications
- **Korean NLP Research**: Benchmarking Korean language models
- **Relation Extraction**: Developing better RE systems
- **Multilingual AI**: Testing cross-lingual capabilities

### Practical Applications
- **Information Extraction**: Building knowledge graphs from Korean text
- **Question Answering**: Supporting relation-based QA systems
- **Document Analysis**: Extracting structured information from documents
