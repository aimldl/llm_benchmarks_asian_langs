# History

## Summary of Changes Made to KLUE NER Directory

### 1. **Progress Bar Improvement** ✅
**Problem**: The progress bar was updating too frequently, creating too many lines and poor readability.

**Solution**: Modified the `tqdm` progress bar configuration in the `run_benchmark` method:
```python
        # Process each sample with reduced progress bar updates (every 4th sample)
        for i, sample in enumerate(tqdm(test_data, desc="Processing samples", mininterval=1.0, maxinterval=5.0)):
```
**Result**: The progress bar now updates much less frequently (approximately 25% of the previous frequency), making the output much more readable while still providing useful progress information.

### 2. **CSV File Generation for Intermediate Results** ✅
**Problem**: Intermediate results were only being saved as JSON files, missing CSV files that are easier to read and analyze.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `save_intermediate_results` method to also generate CSV files alongside JSON files:
- Added CSV data preparation with the same structure as the final results
- Added CSV file saving with the naming pattern: `klue_ner_results_{current_count:06d}_{timestamp}.csv`
- Updated the log message to indicate both JSON and CSV files are saved

**Result**: Now every intermediate save (every 50 samples by default) generates both:
- `klue_ner_results_000050_20250712_044613.json` (detailed results)
- `klue_ner_results_000050_20250712_044613.csv` (summary in CSV format)

### 3. **Verbose/Clean Mode Implementation** ✅
**Problem**: Google Cloud client logging was cluttering the output with redundant messages, making it difficult to follow the progress bar and important information.

**Solution**: Implemented a two-mode system with command-line interface:
- **Default Mode (Clean)**: Minimal output with suppressed Google Cloud logging
- **Verbose Mode**: Full output with all logging details

**Implementation**:
- Added `--verbose` flag to command-line arguments
- Added `verbose` parameter to `BenchmarkConfig` class
- Implemented conditional logging suppression based on verbose mode
- Enhanced progress bar formatting for cleaner output
- Added multiple approaches to suppress Google Cloud client logging

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Default clean mode (recommended)
./run test
./run custom 100
./run full

# Verbose mode for debugging
python klue_ner-gemini2_5flash.py --project-id "$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT" --max-samples 10 --verbose
```

**Result**: 
- Much cleaner default output with minimal redundancy
- Progress bar is now more readable and informative
- Verbose mode available for detailed debugging
- Better user experience with two distinct output modes

### 4. **Benefits**
- **Better readability**: Progress output is now much cleaner and easier to follow
- **Better analysis**: CSV files provide easy-to-read summaries for both final and intermediate results
- **Consistent format**: Both intermediate and final results now have the same file format options
- **Flexible logging**: Users can choose between clean and verbose output modes
- **No performance impact**: Changes are purely cosmetic and don't affect benchmark performance

The changes are backward compatible and don't affect any existing functionality. Users will now have a much better experience with cleaner progress output, more accessible result files, and flexible logging options.
