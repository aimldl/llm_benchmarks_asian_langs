@/klue_tc @/klue_nli Refer both to the klue_tc and klue_nli directories and expand them to other KLUE (Korean Language Understanding Evaluation) Task. In other words, I want to create sub_directory klue_mrc for KLUE's Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task.

Keep the directory and file structure consistent with klue_tc and klue_nli and make appropriate changes for the new directory klue_mrc. Be careful to use the evaluation data instead of the test data when you evaluate Gemini 2.5 Flash's performance. Additionally, don't be shy to make your prompt long and detailed enough to achieve a better performance when you call Gemini 2.5 Flash and perform the task. If the prompt is too short, the performance may degrade, so don't be shy.

At the end of this work, provide me the summary of Performance Metrics and Key Differences from TC, STS, NLI, NER, RE, DP tasks in the KLUE benchmarks.
